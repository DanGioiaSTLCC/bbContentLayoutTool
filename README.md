# bbContentLayoutTool
A Blackboard 'javascript hack' for easily dropping html layout artifacts into the Blackboard WYSIWIG editor.

<h3>Background</h3>

This hack allows Blackboard content editors (Academics/etc.) with little or no HTML knowledge to drop HTML layouts into the WYSIWIG editor, ready for content entry. It was built as part of Blackboard+, an initiative of the University of the Sunshine Coast's C~SALT (Centre for Support and Advancement of Learning and Teaching) team.
